# Loops in Shell Scripting

Loops are fundamental control structures in shell scripting that allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. They are particularly useful for automating repetitive tasks and processing collections of data. In this document, we will explore the different types of loops available in shell scripting, their syntax, and practical examples.

## Types of Loops

### 1. For Loop
The `for` loop is used to iterate over a list of items. It executes a block of code for each item in the list.

**Syntax:**
```bash
for variable in list
do
    # commands to be executed
done
```

**Example:**
```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```

### 2. While Loop
The `while` loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true.

**Syntax:**
```bash
while [ condition ]
do
    # commands to be executed
done
```

**Example:**
```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]
do
    echo "Count: $count"
    ((count++))
done
```

### 3. Until Loop
The `until` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it continues to execute until a specified condition becomes true.

**Syntax:**
```bash
until [ condition ]
do
    # commands to be executed
done
```

**Example:**
```bash
count=1
until [ $count -gt 5 ]
do
    echo "Count: $count"
    ((count++))
done
```

## Practical Applications
Loops can be used in various scenarios, such as:
- Processing files in a directory
- Iterating over command-line arguments
- Automating repetitive tasks in system administration

## Conclusion
Understanding loops is essential for effective shell scripting. They provide a powerful way to automate tasks and handle data efficiently. By mastering loops, you can enhance your scripting capabilities and improve your productivity in DevOps tasks.
