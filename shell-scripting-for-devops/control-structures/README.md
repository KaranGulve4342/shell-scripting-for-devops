# Control Structures in Shell Scripting

This section covers the fundamental control structures used in shell scripting, which are essential for creating dynamic and efficient scripts. Understanding these concepts will enable you to write scripts that can make decisions, repeat actions, and organize code effectively.

## Overview

In this section, you will learn about:

- **Conditionals**: How to use `if`, `else`, and `case` statements to control the flow of your scripts based on certain conditions.
- **Loops**: Different types of loops (`for`, `while`, and `until`) that allow you to execute a block of code multiple times.
- **Functions**: How to define and use functions to encapsulate code for reuse and better organization.
