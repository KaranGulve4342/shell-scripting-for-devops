# Troubleshooting Guide for Shell Scripting in DevOps

This document provides solutions to common issues that learners may encounter while working with the scripts and examples in this repository. 

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Script Not Executing
- **Issue**: The script does not run when executed.
- **Solution**: Ensure that the script has executable permissions. You can set the permissions using the command:
  ```
  chmod +x script_name.sh
  ```

### 2. Command Not Found
- **Issue**: You receive an error stating that a command is not found.
- **Solution**: Check if the command is installed on your system. You can install missing commands using your package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `brew`).

### 3. Syntax Errors
- **Issue**: The script throws syntax errors.
- **Solution**: Review the script for typos or incorrect syntax. Use a shell script linter or run the script with `bash -n script_name.sh` to check for syntax errors without executing it.

### 4. Unexpected Output
- **Issue**: The output of the script is not as expected.
- **Solution**: Add debugging statements (e.g., `echo` commands) to print variable values and track the flow of execution. You can also run the script with `bash -x script_name.sh` to enable debugging mode.

### 5. Environment Variables Not Set
- **Issue**: The script relies on environment variables that are not set.
- **Solution**: Ensure that all required environment variables are defined. You can set them in your terminal session or within the script itself.

### 6. File Not Found
- **Issue**: The script cannot find a specified file.
- **Solution**: Check the file path and ensure that the file exists. Use absolute paths if necessary to avoid confusion.

### 7. Permission Denied
- **Issue**: You encounter a "permission denied" error when trying to access a file or directory.
- **Solution**: Check the file permissions using `ls -l file_name` and modify them if necessary using `chmod`.

## Additional Resources
- For more detailed troubleshooting, consider consulting the documentation for the specific commands you are using.
- Online forums and communities can also be helpful for resolving specific issues.
