## Version Control Systems

- Basic knowledge of version control systems, particularly Git, will help you manage your scripts and collaborate with others.

## Networking Basics

- A fundamental understanding of networking concepts can be helpful, especially when working with scripts that interact with remote servers or cloud services.

By ensuring you meet these prerequisites, you will be better prepared to engage with the materials in this repository and enhance your skills in shell scripting for DevOps.
